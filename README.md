Deathcounter and Soundboard

This application allows you to keep a track of deaths or pretty much anything else.
You can assign keys to count up, down and cycle through counters.
This way you can use a lot of counters without having to AltTab out of game.

It also enables you to assign sounds to be played by pressing keys.
